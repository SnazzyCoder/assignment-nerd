        <h1>Our Journey</h1>
        <p class="content">We started off as a group of 2 High-School Graduates, for helping those in need of immediate help in things they don't know, or donâ€™t have time for. Overtime, our customers started recommending us to others, and now, we are more than happy to help more than 200+ students within a span of 6 months.</p>

        <h1>Our vision</h1>
        <p class="content">We thrive to help as many students struggling with academics, and make assignments a blessing to them more than a burden. Students have reported that they can spend time in what they really want to do, rather than scratch their heads over the format of a logistics contract, or a calculus assessment, which they may never use in their life.</p>
        <p class="content">Over the pace of 3 months, we envision to help more than double the people we have done in the past 6 months, connecting needy students with professional writers.</p>
